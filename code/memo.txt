Description of the Prior Art</p>\n<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional semiconductor process forms various semiconductor components by applying masks used for patterning wafers and semiconductor substrates. As the development of integrated circuit technologies progresses, products are becoming miniaturized, and thereby the density of circuit layouts and critical lines in semiconductor devices becomes more precise. Due to this trend, the defect tolerances of mask patterns in masks are reduced. An important issue in the field is therefore how to detect defects of mask patterns and eliminate those defects that would cause reduction in yields.</p>\n<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When defects are found they may be repaired, or masks may be abandoned for those defects that are impossible or not easy to be repaired. Additionally, some problems caused by defects may become worse as the defects are repaired; in other words, defect elimination requires a lot of time and money. To simplify the process, only those defects which could cause reverse effects when transferred to wafers during exposure should be eliminated. Images of a same mask pattern transferred to wafers with different processing parameters will be different, leading to different effects upon the wafers, so it is difficult to accurately simulate the transferring results of a mask in a specific parameter.</p>\n<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention therefore provides a mask inspecting method, which can simulate the transferring images on a wafer from a mask pattern accurately to resolve the aforesaid problems of mask defects, thereby reducing processing cost and processing time.</p>\n<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a mask inspecting method including the following steps. A processing parameter is defined. An incident light is decided by the processing parameter. At least a portion of the incident light is emitted and passes through a first position and a second position of a first area of a mask, to detect a first parameter and a second parameter respectively corresponding to the first position and the second position, and then compares the variation of the first parameter and the second parameter. At least a portion of the incident light is emitted and passes through a third position and a fourth position of a second area of a mask, to detect a third parameter and a fourth parameter respectively corresponding to the third position and the fourth position, and then compares the variation of the third parameter and the fourth parameter.</p>\n<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a mask inspecting method, which applies the same light (energy) to detect defects in different positions of different areas of one mask.

As shown in Patent-Figure, a device 100 may be an Aerial Image Measurement System (AIMS) device. The device 100 includes a light source 110, a mask 120 and a photodetector 130.\n\nThe light source 110 provides a light 10 that is emitted to the mask 120 so that the light 10 is incident on the mask 120. The light source 110 may include a mercury lamp emitting light with 365 nm wavelength, an argon fluoride excimer laser emitting light with 193 nm wavelength, or a krypton fluoride excimer laser emitting light with 248 nm wavelength etc, for providing the light 10 with needed energy or wave band. The light 10 may be an ultraviolet (UV) light, a deep ultraviolet (DUV) light, an X-ray, a light with 365 nm wavelength (I-line), a light with 248 nm wavelength, or a light with 193 nm wavelength. The light 10 is chosen depending upon the properties of the mask 120 and exposure process environment being simulated.\n\nAt least a portion of the light 10 emitted to the mask 120 passes through the mask 120 and transforms to a light 20. The mask 120 has mask patterns thereon, and the mask patterns are designed according to integrated circuit patterns which need to be formed on a semiconductor substrate. In one embodiment, the mask may include an absorbing layer, a metal film, an inorganic film, a binary intensity mask (BIM), a phase-shift mask (PSM) or an optical proximity correction (OPC) mask etc. Thus, the light 20 and light 10 may have different or the same phase, amplitude, direction, wavelength etc. depending upon the properties of the mask 120.\n\nThe light 20 is emitted to the photodetector 130 disposed in the light path of the light 20; that is, in the light path of the light 10 after it passes through the mask 120. The light 20 is then received by the photodetector 130 for detecting images or parameters corresponding to mask patterns of the mask 120, wherein the photodetector 130 may be a light reaction membrane, a particle sensor, a CMOS image sensor, or a coupled device image sensor etc.\n\nThe device 100 may further include a processor 140 that connects to the photodetector 130, receives and analyzes the detecting data of the photodetector 130, and then determines whether defects of the mask pattern of the mask 120 need to be repaired or not.\n\nThe present invention provides a mask inspecting method applying the aforesaid device 100 to inspect defects of the mask patterns of the mask 120. Patent-Figure schematically depicts a flow chart of a mask inspecting method according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Patent-Figure, a processing parameter P is defined according to the properties of the mask 120 and the setups of the mask 120 set during manufacturing (Step K1). For example, a processing parameter P may be a critical dimension of a test pattern on the mask 120, such as a CD-bar, but it is not limited thereto, wherein any product or layer should have a CD-bar (often disposed on a scribe lane); the minimum rule for the product or layer is illustrated. The energy of the incident light 10 can be decided by the processing parameter P (Step K2) . In this embodiment, the energy threshold corresponding to the critical dimension is used as the energy of the light 10. After the energy of the light 10 is decided, the light 10 is made to emit to areas of the mask 120 which need to be inspected, and at least a portion of the light 10 is made to pass through the mask 120 to reach the photodetector 130, in order to detect parameters corresponding to respective patterns in these areas having the light 10 emitted, and then compare the variations of these parameters (Step K3).\n\nPatent-Figure schematically depicts a diagram of a dense pattern area of a mask according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention. Patent-Figure schematically depicts a diagram of an isolated pattern area of a mask according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Patent-Figure, when a defect d1 (shown on the right-hand side of Patent-Figure) included in a first position S1 of a first area 120A of the mask 120 is found, the light 10 is made to emit to the first position S1 to detect and get a corresponding first parameter P1. Thereafter, the light 10 is made to emit to the second position S2, which is a non-defect area (as shown on the left-hand side of Patent-Figure), to detect and get a corresponding second parameter P2. Then, the variation of the first parameter P1 and the second parameter P2 is compared. When the variation of the first parameter P1 and the second parameter P2 is larger than a predetermined variation tolerance, this means the defect dl needs to be repaired. When the variation of the first parameter P1 and the second parameter P2 is smaller than a predetermined variation tolerance, this means the defect dl in a predetermined processing environment will not cause reverse effects to processes. Therefore, the defect d1 can be ignored.\n\nAreas with different optical properties of the mask 120 are inspected by the same incident light 10. As shown in Patent-Figure, when a defect d2 included in a third position S3 of a second area 120B of the mask 120 is found (as shown on the right-hand side of Patent-Figure), the same light 10 is made to emit to the third position S3 to detect and get a corresponding third parameter P3. Then, the same light 10 is made to emit to the fourth position S4, which includes a non-defect area (as shown on the left-hand side of Patent-Figure) to detect and get a corresponding fourth parameter P4. Thereafter, the variation of the third parameter P3 and the fourth parameter P4 is compared. When the variation of the third parameter P3 and the fourth parameter P4 is larger than a predetermined variation tolerance, this means the defect d2 needs to be repaired. When the variation of the third parameter P3 and the forth parameter P4 is smaller than a predetermined variation tolerance, this means the defect d2 in a predetermined processing environment will not cause reverse effects to processes. Therefore, the defect d2 can be ignored.\n\nThe first parameter P1, the second parameter P2, the third parameter P3 and the fourth parameter P4 in this embodiment are the critical dimensions corresponding to various positions of mask patterns, but are not limited thereto. Additionally, the second area 120B of this embodiment has different optical properties from the first area 120A, but it is not limited thereto. For instance, the first area 120A and the second area 120B may have different pattern densities. In this embodiment, the first area 120A as shown in Patent-Figure is a dense pattern area, and the second area 120B is an isolated pattern area. The isolated pattern area has a largest separation between adjacent features and the dense pattern area has a smallest separation between adjacent features. In other words, the dense pattern area and the isolated pattern area respectively represent the highest density area and the lowest density area of a wafer, therefore the critical dimension of every areas in a wafer is in the range between the dense pattern area and the isolated pattern area.\n\nThe emitting order of the light 10 can be changed. For example, the second position S2 may be emitted first and then the first position S1 is emitted, or the fourth position S4 may be emitted first and then the third position S3 is emitted. Furthermore, the light 10 is not restricted to emit to the first position S1 and the second position S2 of the first area 120A of the mask 120. It can also emit to another position or other positions (a single position or multiple positions) in the first area 120A, to respectively detect parameters corresponding these positions, and then compare the variations of these parameters, the first parameter P1 or the second parameter P2; the same applies to the second area 120B. The light 10 of the present invention is not restricted to emit to the first area 120A and the second area 120B of the mask 120; it may also emit to multiple positions in other areas of the mask 120 and is not limited thereto.\n\nIt should be noted that the present invention uses the same light 10, which has the same energy, to emit to different areas of the mask 120 such as the first area 120A and the second area 120B, to respectively detect defects indifferent areas.
